      <h3>01 - Hello World</h3>
      <p>
        Okay we're going to make the simplest program in MOSS assembly that produces some output. This will still go through some of the basic outlines of a program.
      </p>
      <pre>main:
    PRINT "Hello world\n"</pre>
      <p>
        Pretty simple, however it introduces some important parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>First</strong> notice the <code>main:</code>, that's a label. Labels are like landmarks in the code, they allow program flow commands to move between
        sections of the code as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In addition</strong>, the <code>main</code> label is the entry point for your code. While in this simple example the entry point is self evident, 
        in more complex examples with code being pulled in from other places. Such as the standard math library, if the program always started at the first 
        piece of code it'd make the code a bit messier.
      </p>
      <strong>Second</strong> we have our first command. All commands are expected to be uppercase.
    </div>

    <div id="exercise-02" class="section">
      <h3>02 - Registers</h3>
      <p>
        So lets look at one of the basic parts of the CPU, registers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A register is container in the CPU that can have calculations performed on it. For instance if you want to add, subtract, multiple, divide any numbers, you must perform
        these operations on a register or hardcoded number.
      </p>
      <pre>main:
    MOV r0 5      ; Can be read as register 0 = 5
    MOV r1 8      ; Can be read as register 1 = 8
    ADD r2 r0 r1  ; Can be read as register 2 = register 0 + register 1
    ADD r2 3      ; Can be read as register 2 += 3
    INFO r2       ; Debug command for displaying information about a register.</pre>
    </div>

    <div id="exercise-03" class="section">
      <h3>03 - Inputs</h3>
      <p>
        While in a more complete solution the CPU would talk to a virtualised keyboard or file system for input. For now however there are some debugging commands for
        getting keyboard input which will be useful for examples. The INPUT and INPUTF commands allow you to get some user input.
      </p>
      <pre>main:
    PRINT "Enter your age: "
    INPUT r0
    PRINT "You are "
    PRINT r0
    PRINT " years old\n"</pre>
      <p>
        Again a fairly simple program to demonstrate that input numbers get put into registers and that the PRINT command can be used to output register values.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="exercise-04" class="section">
      <h3>04 - Program Flow</h3>
      <p>
        So lets assume for now that you have some code that you want to skip, because it doesn't need to be run. This can be done with the JMP command which jumps to a 
        different place in the code with a label.
      </p>
      <pre>main:
    PRINT "Hello there, how are you?\n"
    JMP one_sided_conversation                ; This will jump to the one_sided_conversation label, 
&nbsp;                                             ; thus skipping the next PRINT command, 
&nbsp;                                             ; giving us a one-sided conversation.
    PRINT "I'm good thanks, how are you?\n"

  one_sided_conversation:
    PRINT "I'm good thank you.\n"</pre>
      <p>
        While it is useful to be able to jump to anywhere in the code at any time, often we want to do it based on some current state of the program.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="exercise-05" class="section">
      <h3>05 - Conditionals</h3>
      <p>
        So we can jump to another part of the code using a label, but we want to jump to another part of the code based on some user input now.
        We can do this using the CMP and CMPF commands, these change weather or not a conditional operator will let a command execute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets use the scenario of checking if someone is old enough to drink (assuming a drinking age of 18) and printing different messages.
      </p>
      <pre>main:
    PRINT "Enter your age: "
    INPUT r0
    CMP r0 18
    &gt;= PRINT "You're old enough to drink.\n" ; Will print if input age is greater than or equal to 18.
    &lt; PRINT "You're too young to drink.\n"   ; Will print if the input age is less than 18.</pre>
      <p>
        The conditional operators will only allow commands to execute if they satisfy the previous CMP or CMPF command values.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also pair a conditional operator with a JMP command to affect which parts of the code get executed depending on current state.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="exercise-06" class="section">
      <h3>06 - Looping</h3>
      <p>
        So we can compare and perform certain actions using conditionals, so lets make a more traditional looking for loop. Lets just have one print the numbers 1 to 10.
      </p>
      We can also look at this side by side with what a for loop looks like in a higher level language like Javascript.
      <pre>main:
    MOV r0 1                ; for (var i = 0     loop setup
start_of_loop:
    CMP r0 10               ; i &lt; 10             loop conditional
    &gt;= JMP end_of_loop
&nbsp;                           ; { 
    PRINT r0                ;
    PRINT "\n"              ;    console.log(i);
&nbsp;                           ; }
&nbsp;
    INC r0                  ; i++)               loop incrementer
    JMP start_of_loop 

end_of_loop:
    PRINT "Loop complete\n" ; console.log("Loop complete")</pre>
      <p>
        The MOSS assembly is a bit more verbose than a higher level language like Javascript, however it performs the same actions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>07 - The Stack</h3>
      <p>
        The stack is an important part of the CPU, it allows for different parts of the code to communicate without needing to know what registers each
        part is using. In fact there are entire processors that are designed around using a stack for everything and don't use registers at all, so they are very useful.
      </p>
      <pre>main:    ; The stack starts empty.
    PUSH 1      ; The stack now contains [ 1 ]
    PUSH 2      ; The stack now contains [ 1, 2 ]
    POP r1      ; The stack now contains [ 1 ]
    POP r2      ; The stack is now empty.
    INFO r1     ; Prints 2
    INFO r2     ; Prints 1
