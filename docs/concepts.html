      <h3>Command Argument Types</h3>
      <div>
        Each command has a list of acceptable arguments that can be used (including no arguments).
        The types must match a valid form of a command otherwise the code is invalid.

        <div>
          Each line is split into tokens, a valid command must look something like this:
          <pre>[optional conditional] [command] [any number of arguments]</pre>
        </div>

        <div>For example:
          <pre>main:
MOV r0 4        ; Is split into ['MOV', 'r0' '4']
MOV r1 6.7      ; Is split into ['MOV', 'r0', '6.7']
CMPF r1 10.0    ; Is split into ['CMPF', 'r1', '10.0']
&gt; INCF r1       ; Is split into ['&gt;', 'INCF', 'r1']
&lt; DECF r1       ; Is split into ['&lt;', 'DECF', 'r1']</pre>
        </div>

            <td>
              A register referes to one of the registers in the CPU. 
              They are always referenced with a lowercase R followed by a number, 
              eg <code>r0</code> or <code>r12</code>. 
              Each register can hold one 32bit value, either a 32bit integer or 32bit float.
              <div>For example:
                <pre>ADD r0 r1           ; Add register 1 onto register 0. </pre>

            </td>
            <td>
              Integer values can only store whole numbers. They are officially called 
              immediate values however here I've simply called them integers. 
              The name immediate value comes from the fact that the value is known 'immediately' 
              at compile time and so will be part of the code and no further look ups are 
              required to get the value.

              <div>For example:
                <pre>MOV r0 7            ; Set register 0 to the integer 7.
ADD r0 6            ; Add the interger 6 to register 0.</pre>

            </td>
            <td>
              Floating Immediate value, or simply a float value which is a value that 
              can hold decimal numbers.

              <div>For example:
                <pre>MOV r0 8.3          ; Set register 0 to the float 8.3.
SUBF r0 3.3         ; Subtract the float 3.3 from register 0.</pre>

              <div>Any Number</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              Number. For commands where either an integer or float value is acceptable.
              Such as the PUSH command which pushes a value onto the stack, it doesn't care if it's
              an integer or a float, they're both 32bits of information.

              <div>For example:
                <pre>PUSH 4              ; Put an integer onto the stack.
PUSH 8.9            ; Put a float onto the stack.
POP r0              ; Take the top most value and store it in register 0.
POP r1              ; Take the next top most value and store it in register 1.</pre>

              <div>String</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              String value. This is a bit of a special case because strings cannot be created at
              run time just yet, however they can be compiled in and used for 
              debugging purposes. 
              They are a list of characters surrounded by " (double quote) characters. 
              The \\n sequence can be used to output a new line.

              <div>For example:
                <pre>PRINT "-- Here are the results --\\n"
PRINT "r0 = "
PRINT r0
PRINT "\\n"</pre>

              Memory location value. If you want to store values somewhere more long lasting you
              should store them into memory somewhere. A memory location is just a value to
              somewhere in memory that is currently stored in a register.

              <div>For example:
                <pre>MOV r0 5        ; Set the memory location to 5.
MOV @r0 10      ; Set the memory at the location stored in register 0 (which is 5) to be 10.
INC r0          ; Increment the memory pointer.
MOV @r0 15      ; Set the memory at the location stored in register 0 (which is now 6) to be 15.

MOV r1 @5       ; Set register 1 to the memory in position 5.
MOV r2 @6       ; Set register 2 to the memory in position 6.

              Memory location offset value. Just like the memory location that used a register
              for the location, the offset value is just a hardcoded number.

                <pre>MOV @0 756      ; Set the memory in position 0 to 756.

              Within the CPU there is a special register called the flags register.
              This one register can store up to 32 different true/false values that are can be
              used by the CPU and program to communicate. It is possible to set these flags
              manually using the MOV command. However some are only intended to be viewed
              rather than set directly.

                    The value of this flag will affect if a conditional operator
                    allows a command to execute or not.

      <h3>Labels</h3> 
      <div>
        Labels are positions in the code that are given a name. Having a label means that commands like JMP, CALL and REGI can be used to move around to differents parts of the code.
      </div>
      <div>
        All labels must end with a colon (:) character to indicate that they are a label, a colon is not needed when referring to them via a command.
      </div>
      <div>For example:
        <pre>    MOV r0 0
start_loop:
    CMP r0 10
    &gt;= JMP end_loop
    PRINT r0
    PRINT "\\n"

      </div>
      <div>
        The <strong>main</strong> label is the only label htat is required for ever program as it indicates where in the code the program should start.

        <pre>my_func1:
    POP r0
    MUL r0 3
    PUSH r0
    RETURN

main:
    PRINT "Start of program\\n"
    PUSH 5
    CALL my_func1
    POP r5
    INFO r5</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
        The function <code>my_func1</code> and any of it's code is not executed on startup because the first thing that's called is the <code>PRINT</code> command.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="conditionals" class="section">
      <h3>Conditionals</h3>
      <div>
        By default all commands are executed when the CPU encounters the command. However there are times when we want to do different things depending
        on some state that the program is in. Basically you need conditionals to make if statements, loops and switch cases work.
      </div>
      <div>
        A conditional is an operator at the start of a command line. The thing that determins if a conditional is true or not is based on the last time
        either the CMP or CMPF commands were executed. 
      </div>

      <div>For example:
        <pre>main:
    MOV r0 8
    CMP r0 10
    == PRINT "8 == 10"      ; Will <strong>not</strong> print as 8 equals 10 is false.
    != PRINT "8 != 10"      ; Will print as 8 does not equal 10 is true.
    &gt;  PRINT "8 &gt;  10"      ; Will <strong>not</strong> print as 8 is greater than 10 is false.
    &gt;= PRINT "8 &gt;= 10"      ; Will <strong>not</strong> print as 8 is greater than or equal to 10 is false.
    &lt;  PRINT "8 &lt;  10"      ; Will print as 8 is less than 10 is true.
    &lt;= PRINT "8 &lt;= 10"      ; Will print as 8 is less than or equal to 10 is true.</pre>
      </div>
      While any command can have a conditional in front of it and it can make certain logic problems somehwhat easy to solve with just a conditional infront 
      of several different commands, the main use will still be with the JMP command.

      <div>For example, this snippet of Javascript:
        <pre>var age = 20;
if (age &gt; 30) {
    console.log("Older than 30")
}
else if (age &gt; 15) {
    console.log("Older than 15")
}
else {
    console.log("Younger than or equal to 15");
}</pre>
        <div>
          While this is a somewhat contrived example as it would be prime for simply adding conditionals to each PRINT command, here we are trying to show the link between if statements and JMP commands:
        </div>
        <pre>main:
    MOV r0 20      ; We'll assume r0 to be the age variable.
    CMP r0 30
    &gt; JMP older_than_30
    &gt; JMP older_than 15
    PRINT "Younger than or equal to 15\\n"
    JMP end

older_than_30:
    PRINT "Older than 30\\n"
    JMP end

older_than_15:
    PRINT "Older than 15\\n"
    JMP end

end:</pre>
